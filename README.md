# AngularComponentLibrary

This project is to understand how to create npm ready angular component libraries to use in an angular application.

After, generating an angular application for the demo we will follow below steps to create component library
1. Generate a library project by running following command  
```ng generate library ratify --prefix=lib```
2. Library project will be created with one default exported component ```lib-ratify```
3. Lets write some code snippet to make ```lib-ratify``` to behave like a rating component.
4. You can find the source code of rating component [here](www.google.com)
